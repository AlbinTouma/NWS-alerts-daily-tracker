[The National Weather Service (NWS)](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) publishes critical forecasts, alerts, and observations, along with other weather data. 

The bash script uses curl to get weather data from NWS api and saves the information to the alerts.json. The script runs daily.
